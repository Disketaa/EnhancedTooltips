üóÉÔ∏è**Detailed Changelog: [1.2.3 --> 1.3.0](https://github.com/UltimatChamp/EnhancedTooltips/compare/1.2.3+fabric.1.21.4...1.3.0+fabric.1.21.4)**

### üõ†Ô∏èChanges

- Major changes to **item badges**.
  - Badges are now based on the _Creative Menu item groups_. _(The way item groups work, this is unfortunately very much hard-coded. Mods will have to manually add their custom items if they want them to show their badges.)_
  - Most of the items are covered now.
  - Badges are now available only for 1.21+. _(If you want them in previous versions and are ready to do some work, contact me on [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/kfKjjhv3pn))_

- Added a **durability bar** behind the durability, which changes color based on how damaged the item is.
